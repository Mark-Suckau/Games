-allow window resizing with screen
-increase player size instead of zooming closer (zooming reduces resolution)
-improve engine and use it (use delta time, fixed timestep loop)

-revamp game entities to use arrays
-revamp controller class to use arrays
-add optimization to stop rendering objects if they are offscreen

-always round all objects x and y pos to whole numbers to avoid weird screen glitching

-find way to maintain aspect ratio when game world has diff aspect ratio to canvas

-change frictionCoeff for different sides of objects (less on sides and bottom)

BUGS:
-player is able to slightly move into walls if against wall and holding arrow key towards wall
-when player jumps straight up and collides with world bottom when falling a small flicker at bottom of
player rect appears (with trail on)

-when display size < game world size && display aspect ratio != 1:1 
-> proper aspect ratio matching does not occur for buffer canvas

-when aspect ratio != 1:1 -> camera zooming alters aspect ratio

Currently  working on:
-maintaining aspect ration when game world size is different to display canvas size
  -fixing bug: when display size < game world size && display AE != 1:1 && game AE != 1:1 && game height > game width 
-> proper aspect ratio matching does not occur for buffer canvas
